# code_practice
My official repo for all code challenge practice. Folders for each website I use or have used (i.e. edabit, codesignal, leetcode, etc.)

I don't use every website each day so some profiles may be lackluster. The goal of this repo is to display the combined efforts spent across each code practice platform.
